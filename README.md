=====================

Online Music store simulation using SOAP/REST/MessageQueueing 

Just a test to test a few technologies. The general idea is to allow any given frontend app (in this case a simple winform was used)
to use a fully async, web services based backend to order music. 

The CDFactory component is supposed to process the orders by creating a downloadable zip file containing the ordered songs.
